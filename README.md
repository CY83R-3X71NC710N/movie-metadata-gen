# movie-metadata-gen
Movie metadata generator

```
- What does (a certain line of your code) do?:
Line 64: this prints information about the movie class as per __str__ function setup

- How would you explain to a new student what the difference between objects and classes is?: The difference between an object and a class is that an object is a spawn of a class.

- How might this Movie class be useful to us? What programs could it help us to write?:
Maybe I own a movie theater and want a movie screening menu according to a certain standard.

- A Movie object in python is meant to simulate something in the real world (a real movie). Compare this simulated object to its real world counterpart. How are they similar, and how are they different?:
Well, we did not add a watch function. In real life you can watch and load a movie. In my program I did not add a watch function as this is beyond this class. One similarity would likely be that real life movie still contain metadata just like my program.
